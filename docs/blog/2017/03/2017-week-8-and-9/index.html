<p>Written on <time datetime="2017-03-05 19:43:16 &#43;0100 CET">05. Mar 2017</time>  </p>
            <p>It turns out that a lot of my time is actually spent working or playing games - so there's not too much to tell and weekly updates become hard-ish to write. I am going to go with bi-weekly or even monthly updates from now on. So this post is week eight and week nine - week nine being the week the <a href="http://amzn.to/2lLRcN1">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2msN60T">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> were released.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure to see German Hip-Hop/Rap band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopen_Gang">Antilopen Gang</a> live for the first time and I was simply blown away. I expected a rather chill concert but got one and a half hours of full blown Hip-Hop and Punk. The Punk elements are &ldquo;new&rdquo; within their music and I love it. I can't wait for the next time I will be able to see them live. 5/7 would recommend. üëç</p>
<h2 id="nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>As I mentioned I pre-ordered the <a href="http://amzn.to/2lLRcN1">Nintendo Switch</a> and I am in love with it. As expected the Switch is a solid and beautifully made device. It might be a <em>bit</em> to big for in-hand playing but I got used to it after a few hours. I got Breath of the Wild, the newest title in the <em>The Legend Of Zelda</em> series with the switch and have been playing it four roughly 10 hours.</p>

<p>I am madly in love. The last time I fell so quickly for a Zelda game was when I first played Majora‚Äôs Mask (still my favorite in the series) which I could not let go for a minute. Of course the first things I did was running around and finding out how things work and what the game has to offer, collection everything I found like apples, monster parts, and weapons. Story-wise I found the first Shrines, which are tiny trials (=_puzzles_) one needs to solve to gain a Spirit Orb. Apparently, there are no heart containers to collect like in previous games. Spirit Orbs can be traded at shrines to the gods. If Link has enough they offer to trade 4 Spirit Orbs for either a Heart Container or a Stamina vessel, increasing either the number of Hearts or the Stamina available.</p>
<p>New in Breath Of The Wild is food cooking. Food can be cooked by finding a cooking pot. To cook food you need to open the menu (<em>+</em>), and then select the ingredient and select &ldquo;Hold&rdquo; - up to five ingredients can be put into a pot for cooking. If the ingredients are combined correctly a elexir or dish is the result, as shown below.</p>

<p>The cooked food restores more health and - based on ingredients - grands additional effects like increased armor, speed, or stealth. I like this system and it's fun to experiment with different ingredients.</p>
<p>That's it for week 8 and 9. See you next week. Or the week after. üëã</p>

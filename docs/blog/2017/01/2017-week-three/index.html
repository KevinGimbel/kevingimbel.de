<p>Written on <time datetime="2017-01-22 11:44:43 &#43;0100 CET">22. Jan 2017</time>  </p>
            <p>Another week another short review! The third week of 2017 had a lot of travel because I attended an <a href="https://elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> training course in Munich to learn more about Elasticsearch hands-on. The two day course was exiting and I enjoyed my time, learning quite a lot about the different features of Elasticsearch and Kibana. Part of the course material is a 500 page PDF file which is a copy of the presentation held during the two days - I am glad I got it because it&rsquo;s a great reference to look at.</p>

<p>Munich was cold with -7°C to -10°C and there was a lot of snow - for a few days it was nice but I&rsquo;m happy to be back in the middle of Germany without snow. I stayed at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/197005">an Airbnb</a> because all hotels around the city were booked due to a big conference in town. If you want to visit Munich check out the above room - it&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p>During my trip to and from Munich I also had to work at a Starbucks and on the train. Both places are not perfect for working if you&rsquo;re used to a second monitor and having space around you. Starbucks was also really loud which can get annoying - good thing there&rsquo;s music! What helped me tremendously was the MacBook battery life. I can get an average of 8-10 hours of battery life which is simply astonishing.</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open source</h3>
<p>I also helped <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2946">track down a bug</a> with Gulp and hugo, and then decided to tweet what I have been doing for the past two month: <a href="https://twitter.com/_kevinatari/status/821773139617218562">Following an open source project</a></p>
<p>Following an open source project is quite interesting. I read a lot of the hugo issue reports and look at the Pull Requests submitted. This helps me see how to handle pull requests and open source and in my opinion <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo">the hugo project</a> is a good example.</p>
<h3 id="star-trek">Star Trek</h3>
<p>I finished The Original Series and now started to watch The Next Generation. It&rsquo;s the first time I watch everything in the correct order and I&rsquo;m exited!</p>
<p>I also programmed a bit and build a text to 1337speak converter <a href="https://github.com/kevingimbel/leetscript">node module</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/kevingimbel/leetscript-cli">cli tool</a> which uses the first module. I&rsquo;m not yet sure why you would need this type of one-way converter but it was an interesting task to build a node module, publish it, and then use it in a script - I&rsquo;ll try and wrap it up in a post.</p>
<p>I also wrote a blog post about <a href="/deploy-a-static-site-with-git/">deploying a site with git</a> - which is what I am doing with my website at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="not-on-tour">Not On Tour</h3>
<p>On Friday I saw <a href="https://notontour.bandcamp.com/">Not On Tour</a> live with my girlfriend. Not On Tour is a Punk / Hardcore Punk Band from Tel Aviv and I loved every bit of the concerts. The concert was in a small venue with around 50-100 people and they sounded a bit harder live then I expected - and a lot more powerful. I would recommend seeing them live whenever you get a chance. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPhmT5rgJvw/?taken-by=kevingimbel">Here&rsquo;s a little Instagram video</a>.</p>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>Here are some interesting things from this week:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTD-FJVY9rE">All Fallout Intros, 1997-2015</a> - seeing all the intros to one of my favorite game series is great.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14258474/trump-inauguration-science-politics-climate-change-vaccines">Yes, science is political</a> - The Verge on why science is political and how science and politics play together. A sad read in the upcome of &ldquo;Trumps America&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa#.3n5g6mfdr">Bits, Bytes, Building With Binary</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/@vaidehijoshi">Vaidehi Joshi</a> - a post about bits and bytes and how they work. Vaidehi started a series called <a href="https://medium.com/basecs">basecs</a> which aims to explain how computers actually work. I highly recommend reading it!</p>
<p><a href="http://kunststube.net/encoding/">What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs To Know About Encodings And Character Sets To Work With Text</a> by David Zentgraf - an interesting read about handling encoding and how encoding works.</p>

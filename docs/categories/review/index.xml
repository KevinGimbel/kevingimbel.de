The two books connect seamlessly and Lord of Souls finishes the storylines which all somewhat interconnect at the end. From first to last page it is incredibly exciting and expends the lore of Umbriel, the floating city that kills everything below it just to raise the corpse as an undead army that marches towards the Imperial City.</description></item><item><title>The Infernal City</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/the-infernal-city/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/the-infernal-city/</guid><description>I finally came around to read The Infernal City by Greg Keys. As a huge fan of Elder Scrolls I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to read this book in a long time and in fact had it in my bookshelf for the past 3-4ish years, but I just never took the time to read it.
I absolutely absorbed this book and loved it front to back! It fits quite well into the lore and doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; or wrong.</description></item><item><title>Night on Earth</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/04/night-on-earth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/04/night-on-earth/</guid><description>Last weekend I finished &amp;ldquo;Night on Earth&amp;rdquo; a Netflix documentation about animal life during the night, filmed with super light sensitive cameras making the darkest night look like early evening; It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look into the night and quite entertaining and educating.
You can find the documentation here on Netflix

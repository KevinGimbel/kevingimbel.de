I tried really hard to like it but I just cannot.
Before you continue reading, I want to say that I did not finish the book - I stopped half-way through
The story is not really new or engaging and moves very slowly. The writing style is too detailed for me to form a good image in my mind, every time I have an image of a scene the author adds more and more details and it just keeps changing; It&amp;rsquo;s too much of hard world building for me.</description></item><item><title>Hannah Gadsby - Douglas</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/09/hannah-gadsby-douglas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/09/hannah-gadsby-douglas/</guid><description>Last night my wife and I watched Hannah Gadsbys newest stand-up show called &amp;ldquo;Douglas&amp;rdquo; and within the first minute I was out of breath and laughing because she just hits my humor spot on. Absolutely loved this show! It&amp;rsquo;s a good hour of laughing with serious topics wrapped into jokes, but never feels too uncomfortable.
From the topics and the overall feeling it&amp;rsquo;s not as hard as Nanette, which just left me sobbing during the last half and was a constant rollercoaster because it is very harsh and real and touches a lot of very personal topics; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil - just take an hour and watch it on Netflix.</description></item><item><title>Lord of Souls</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/lord-of-souls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/lord-of-souls/</guid><description>Similar to The Infernal City, I also had Lord of Souls by Greg Keyes standing in my bookshelf for years, and after finishing and loving &amp;ldquo;The Infernal City&amp;rdquo; I was very excited to continue the journey with Lord of Souls.
The two books connect seamlessly and Lord of Souls finishes the storylines which all somewhat interconnect at the end. From first to last page it is incredibly exciting and expends the lore of Umbriel, the floating city that kills everything below it just to raise the corpse as an undead army that marches towards the Imperial City.</description></item><item><title>The Infernal City</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/the-infernal-city/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/08/the-infernal-city/</guid><description>I finally came around to read The Infernal City by Greg Keys. As a huge fan of Elder Scrolls I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to read this book in a long time and in fact had it in my bookshelf for the past 3-4ish years, but I just never took the time to read it.
I absolutely absorbed this book and loved it front to back! It fits quite well into the lore and doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; or wrong.</description></item><item><title>Night on Earth</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/04/night-on-earth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/04/night-on-earth/</guid><description>Last weekend I finished &amp;ldquo;Night on Earth&amp;rdquo; a Netflix documentation about animal life during the night, filmed with super light sensitive cameras making the darkest night look like early evening; It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look into the night and quite entertaining and educating.
You can find the documentation here on Netflix

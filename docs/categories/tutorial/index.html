    <h4>How Apache 2.4.30 and later can be used to automate SSL certificate setup and renewal</h4>

    <p id="article-summary-a9284a3857fe211ba07ec82f63f5c723">Apache 2.4.30 and later supports an experimental module called mod_md which allows automatic SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt as standard provider. This greatly simplifies the management of SSL certificates. Instead of setting up certbot and cronjobs to automatically renew certs server administrators now only need to add a few lines to their virtual host files.
This guide assumes the operating system is Ubuntu! If you use a different distro some commands may be different.</p>

All of these use list templates and render &ldquo;article&rdquo;-like content previews. I wanted to add some content to these lists and Hugo has a special file named _index.md for that. This file can be used to create index pages for lists.
When I did that I somehow also included the index files in the post listings which was not what I wanted, so I added a if statement to my article-preview.</p>

The IT world is changing fast and information can quickly be outdated, so I decided to add an automatically generated note to every post that is older than 4 years. Using the Hugo Math function and Date values it can be accomplished in automated-enough fashion.
Partial First I created a new partial named single-header.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-76c956d0ffd23b597b121349e40c3d2c">calc is a great CSS function to calculate values, e.g. margins or widths. What makes it especially great is that it can combine different values, for example calc(100% - 4rem - 1px) is valid and works in modern browsers - in simpler words: Calc works with different units like em, %, px, etc.
The problem with calc is that if it doesn't work you may get a unexpected result. Take the following code for example:</p>

In fact, all recently opened tabs are available via the multi-tasking button (square to the down right on Stock Android) instead of an in-app button like it used to be. This not only is very handy actually since you can switch between apps and websites seamlessly you can also set your own status bar colors for chrome which are used on the page and in the multi-tasking overview.</p>

My first idea was to have a trigger element that, when clicked, triggeres the nearest Sub Navigation to activate it (e.g. giving it an open class). The JavaScript for this looks like this:
var d = document, trigger = d.</p>

It basically determinse where and how variables or functions are accessable and where not. Since this is an essential part of JavaScript and one can run into quite some problems I want to try and give short introduction to closure and what it can be good for. It's good to have at least basic understanding of JavaScript.
So before I start I'd like to say that I consider myself a JavaScript beginner and this is how I understand closure and scopes at the moment.</p>

The Flags should have different colors and different values (which also have different lengths). The values are applied via the data Attribute and the colors are also controlled via a data Attribute. The &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; with this task was that it's not only a few different length, it's a multi-language system and therefore can end up in a lot of different width of the product flags - a &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; solution, like applying a max-width of let's say 20em, isn't the best solution for this so I ended up creating a flexible solution.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-c0629f466bc6239e6da0e91e8017ff0a">If you follow my blog you might recall that I switched from Jekyll hosted on GitHub to Hugo hosted on Uberspace. Beside the fact I had to create a custom Hugo theme for myself and learn how to run a Hugo blog/website I also had to think about how I am going to deploy my website. Hugo is a static site generator and when executed ($ hugo) it compiles the site from Markdown and HTML templates into a public directory with lots of folders and HTML files.</p>

This little function is called ws and makes switching between projects inside my workspace a lot easier. Both my private and work projects are inside the ~/Development directory.

    <p id="article-summary-da79474eec5139db495f1c20d38367d9">Over 2015 and 2016 I got more and more interested in automating my daily workflows with scripts. For this purpose I learned Bash Scripting (or Shell Scripting) and started writing my first scripts to automate repeating tasks, creating apache vhosts files for example. Recently I started exploring how to implement command line tools in NodeJS and this post should give an overview.

Second, it is now served over HTTPS which is possible because I moved away from GitHub Pages and back to self-hosting my website. Third, and possible most important, I also moved away from Jekyll after using it for three years.
This very site you read right now is build with Hugo, a static site generator build by Steve Francia, Bjørn Erik Pedersen and a lot of contributors.</p>

Whenever I wanted to make some updates, write a post or fix a little buggy thing it only took a few minutes of &ldquo;work&rdquo; to get me really frustrated. Jekyll, despite my love for it, has become horribly slow. My site, which I consider rather &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, took 17-20 seconds to build on every change! Changing the CSS?

    <p id="article-summary-c20430cbc4f76661f0528f2c93d9ee66">Yesterday I finally took a few moments to implement Source Maps with Gulp for one of our client projects at work. I wanted to use the benefits of Source Maps for quite some time but never actually found the time to wrap my head around it (aka throw in another Gulp plugin). Source Maps are used to connect your pre-compiled files, like Sass, with the later compiled CSS - so inside the Dev Tools you can see for every line of CSS from which Sass file it comes - this is super handy once your project get's bigger!</p>

VIM is not that easy to understand, yet a powerful, shortcut-based, distraction free editor. I've already written about turning Sublime Text into VIM mode and my very first VIM impression, but back then I just copy &amp; pasted everything I found on the Internet into my .</p>

Since I'm working in a relativley small company it's most of the time stressy to get all things done and to keep an overview - so long story short: There's not much time for new tools that don't increase my workflow directly. VIM is one of these tools that don't fully support my workflow at the moment.</p>

It was a very early version, kinda heavy and wonky and not what I wanted from an editor I use on a daily base at all. Just today I decided to give it a second look because beside VIM it is the editor I read quite a lot about latly. My first impression was: &ldquo;Wow, that's a simple, clean editor!&rdquo; - exactly the thing I liked so much about Sublime Text 2 which I've been using for the last two years or so.</p>

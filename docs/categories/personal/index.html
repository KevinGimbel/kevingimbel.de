I just realized the last &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; review post was from the beginning of march, namely week 8 and 9, so one month ago. In the meantime I played a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, worked on a Go thing, and went to a concert.

    <p id="article-summary-561b1ef32559d00b6d2ea6a39cbd8b94">It turns out that a lot of my time is actually spent working or playing games - so there&rsquo;s not too much to tell and weekly updates become hard-ish to write. I am going to go with bi-weekly or even monthly updates from now on. So this post is week eight and week nine - week nine being the week the Nintendo Switch and The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were released.</p>

In the second half of week six and through week seven I prepared a workshop which I gave on Friday at the Coding Night. This Coding Night was a special one: The topic was &ldquo;CodingNight feat. CodeDoor feat. Refugees&rdquo; which was a collaboration between CodingNight and CodeDoor. CodeDoor is a project which teaches Refugees coding skills, how to build projects and how to get a Job in the programming field.</p>

I&rsquo;m only 6 months late to do so because I kept saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call next week&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it when I&rsquo;m back from Amsterdam&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it after Christmas&rdquo; - and so on. I am really bad with managing time and work-life balance. If you have any tips on how you manage the things you have to do, hit me up on twitter @_kevinatari.</p>

This week has been rather stressful and loaded with work which is why I did not write any posts or did any programming in my free time. Looking back at the week there&rsquo;s not much to say so this will be a quick read with some reading recommendations at the end.

    <p id="article-summary-ed5f8fabaf2fe1ea6b86f98be729b538">Another week another short review! The third week of 2017 had a lot of travel because I attended an Elasticsearch training course in Munich to learn more about Elasticsearch hands-on. The two day course was exiting and I enjoyed my time, learning quite a lot about the different features of Elasticsearch and Kibana. Part of the course material is a 500 page PDF file which is a copy of the presentation held during the two days - I am glad I got it because it&rsquo;s a great reference to look at.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-55f4e7d3f8c7a9debc6a778fc3c1eebb">This week I spent a lot of time with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and made myself familiar with the backend and the way server / instance management works on AWS. While doing so I also learned that AWS instances are by default not accessible from the internet - they have no open ports and each instance needs a &ldquo;Security Group&rdquo; which defines ways to access the instance. They also do not have Shell access by default.</p>

Reviewing in short what happened in each week of the year is a nice and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; way to recap everything that happened - and it also helps writing this years big review post at the end of the year. I am not sure if I&rsquo;ll keep it up for each week but I will try.</p>

This page is build with Jekyll a blog-aware static site generator you&rsquo;re going to love. I wrote a Guide to get started - so if you consider doing so give it a look.
Beside switching to a new domain I also switched my hoster.</p>

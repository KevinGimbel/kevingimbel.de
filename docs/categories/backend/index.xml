      <description>Apache 2.4.30 and later supports an experimental module called mod_md which allows automatic SSL certificate management with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt as standard provider. This greatly simplifies the management of SSL certificates.

This guide assumes the operating system is Ubuntu! If you use a different distro some commands may be different.</description>

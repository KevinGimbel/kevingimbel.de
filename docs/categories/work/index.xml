      <description>In case your company is using GMail Business there&#39;s one thing that comes to your daily work-life I really love about GMail: Labels. Labels are used to sort eMails automatically and - what I really love about - without removing them from the Inbox into 1000 folders. Instead they just get a Label and their own &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo; inside GMail - on Desktop as well as Mobile which makes them even better!</description>

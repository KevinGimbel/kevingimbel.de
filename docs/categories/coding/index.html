    <p id="article-summary-a9284a3857fe211ba07ec82f63f5c723">Apache 2.4.30 and later supports an experimental module called mod_md which allows automatic SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt as standard provider. This greatly simplifies the management of SSL certificates. Instead of setting up certbot and cronjobs to automatically renew certs server administrators now only need to add a few lines to their virtual host files.
This guide assumes the operating system is Ubuntu! If you use a different distro some commands may be different.</p>

I'd always copy over the front-matter from the last blog post I wrote and then fill in the things I needed - leading to some mistakes (e.g. using category instead of categories) over time.
Archetypes are easy to use, for example to create this post I ran the following command
$ hugo new blog/2020-01-07-using-archetypes-in-hugo.md This copied over the archetype file from archetypes/blog.</p>

This file can be used to create index pages for lists.
When I did that I somehow also included the index files in the post listings which was not what I wanted, so I added a if statement to my article-preview.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-76c956d0ffd23b597b121349e40c3d2c">calc is a great CSS function to calculate values, e.g. margins or widths. What makes it especially great is that it can combine different values, for example calc(100% - 4rem - 1px) is valid and works in modern browsers - in simpler words: Calc works with different units like em, %, px, etc.
The problem with calc is that if it doesn't work you may get a unexpected result. Take the following code for example:</p>

 [&hellip;] PS3 is shown when the select command is waiting for input [&hellip;]
 So the PS3 prompt is shown when a bash program is waiting for user input, and it turns out that the select bash command is used for creating a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; UI in bash.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-8eb4fc37e14fbcb05ad0f9b729edb144">Lately I had a hard time working with my own website. Whenever I wanted to make some updates, write a post or fix a little buggy thing it only took a few minutes of &ldquo;work&rdquo; to get me really frustrated. Jekyll, despite my love for it, has become horribly slow. My site, which I consider rather &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, took 17-20 seconds to build on every change! Changing the CSS? Rebuild entire site.</p>

It is actively developed at Facebook and Instagram, while Instagram uses React to build their web app. At Facebook, however, React plays a role in the &ldquo;background&rdquo;, featuring administrative screens such as the Ads Managment.
React itself says one very important and true thing about itself:
 Lots of people use React as the V in MVC.</p>

I wanted to use the benefits of Source Maps for quite some time but never actually found the time to wrap my head around it (aka throw in another Gulp plugin). Source Maps are used to connect your pre-compiled files, like Sass, with the later compiled CSS - so inside the Dev Tools you can see for every line of CSS from which Sass file it comes - this is super handy once your project get's bigger!</p>

In fact, all recently opened tabs are available via the multi-tasking button (square to the down right on Stock Android) instead of an in-app button like it used to be. This not only is very handy actually since you can switch between apps and websites seamlessly you can also set your own status bar colors for chrome which are used on the page and in the multi-tasking overview.</p>

My first idea was to have a trigger element that, when clicked, triggeres the nearest Sub Navigation to activate it (e.g. giving it an open class). The JavaScript for this looks like this:
var d = document, trigger = d.</p>

It basically determinse where and how variables or functions are accessable and where not. Since this is an essential part of JavaScript and one can run into quite some problems I want to try and give short introduction to closure and what it can be good for. It's good to have at least basic understanding of JavaScript.
So before I start I'd like to say that I consider myself a JavaScript beginner and this is how I understand closure and scopes at the moment.</p>

 Jekyll is built-in GitHub pages Jekyll is easy-to-learn and easy to maintain No-Database handling of Data (see the list of members we use) Everyone can clone the repo and run it locally  So basically, as soon as you have a Project on GitHub or an organization like bullgit you can use the power of Jekyll to make your page easy to use and easy to change even for new members.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-3463fe40997716b0b8b7595b9463fc4e">As soon as you start to really dig into web development it feels like things would change daily - at least I feel that way. But there's one thing that I'd like everyone to do in 2014: At least basic responsive web development to ensure your site - at least - looks good and is usable on whatever screen it will be displayed. There's nothing I hate more than scrolling websites around on my phone when I want to read an article (to be honest, I mostly leave the site and never come back).</p>

    <p id="article-summary-73184b0caa8eb980e0a8810dcf25059a">I first tried Brackets back in my Windows time. It was a very early version, kinda heavy and wonky and not what I wanted from an editor I use on a daily base at all. Just today I decided to give it a second look because beside VIM it is the editor I read quite a lot about latly. My first impression was: &ldquo;Wow, that's a simple, clean editor!&rdquo; - exactly the thing I liked so much about Sublime Text 2 which I've been using for the last two years or so.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-bce148d268be9e1d376dcd74b69996a6">For a recent client Project I had to create Product Flags that are displayed at the top of each product. The Flags should have different colors and different values (which also have different lengths). The values are applied via the data Attribute and the colors are also controlled via a data Attribute. The &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; with this task was that it's not only a few different length, it's a multi-language system and therefore can end up in a lot of different width of the product flags - a &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; solution, like applying a max-width of let's say 20em, isn't the best solution for this so I ended up creating a flexible solution.</p>

Yesterday night's topic was a &ldquo;Back to Top&rdquo; Button written in Vanilla JS.

A few years ago I had to do this once and I remember doing it with an image and background-position but as of today I really love pseudo elements and &ldquo;Look-Ma-No-Image!</p>

It's fair to say that they're all good and which one you use is up to you or your team. I prefer Sass with the SCSS Syntax (= keeps semicolons and brackets).
Even though Pre-Processors are easy to use and setup some people are still confused: Do I have to run them on a server?</p>

As far as I found out it's only working in Chrome and Chromium with the experimental Webkit Features Flag enabled (see at chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-webkit-features).
position:sticky is a pretty handy feature that allows you to stick an element to the top of the page (or wherever you want) until the parent element is moved out of the screen.
Basic Markup To get an idea of how position:sticky works I made some basic markup.</p>

Even Facebook doesn't offer a way to get back to top on their website nor do they on Facebook for Android.
On Android you can simply hit the menu button and the sidebar-like menu will fade in, so there is no problem with not having an &ldquo;scroll to top&rdquo; action because there is no need to get back to the top.</p>

    <p id="article-summary-e2b3d2312d55071ba2b8776aec4cf1b9">I recently stumbled upon the :valid and :invalid class for input fields. It gives you the ability to use visual feedback on inputs that show the user whether the input is - guess what? - valid or not. This is, in fact, a very handy pseudo class in case of UI and UX Design because you can easily give a feedback on input without using JavaScript. Anyway, this pseudo element does not validate the input, the entered email for example can still be formated wrong.</p>

I was using pixel like forever and I couldn't think of any reason to switch to a new unit until Tim explained why em is better: em is more responsive and it is scalable. In fact when you switch from pixel to em you'll feel like working on a completely new Level.</p>

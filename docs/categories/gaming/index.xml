It&amp;rsquo;s stupid and fun, and I love it. It&amp;rsquo;s like someone turned Takeshi&amp;rsquo;s Castle into a video game. You run around parkours with 60 other people, all controlling one of the little blobby-folks seen in the screenshots. There&amp;rsquo;s costumes and multiple rounds, some rounds are team-based like playing soccer with a huge ball, other rounds are all-vs-all.
In general, I enjoyed playing. I played for about an hour last night, and while I had fun I don&amp;rsquo;t really see me playing a lot more since I only have a limited amount of time to play video games and I&amp;rsquo;d rather play Elder Scrolls: Online or Valorant with friends than Fall Guys, but I guess if you just want to play something without thinking too much Fall Guys is your game.</description></item><item><title>Unreal Engine 5 Demo</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/05/unreal-engine-5-demo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/05/unreal-engine-5-demo/</guid><description>Unreal Engine posted a Video on Vimeo showing Unreal Engine 5 running live on a PlayStation 5.
The demo is truly mind-blowing, especially considering it is running on a console and not on a high-end, custom build PC. I knew the PlayStation 5 and the XBox Series X (or whatever the next XBox is called, horrible naming again from XBox ðŸ™„) are powerful and truly next-gen game changing consoles, but this demo just surprised me with its details.</description></item></channel></rss>

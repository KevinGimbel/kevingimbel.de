It was my first time ever I joined a group of other devs and I was more then nervouse about because I - at this time - considered my self more of a Hobby-Dev who&rsquo;s not that skilled. I just started using CodePen a few months before and did some fun demos and experiments there like drawing images with CSS and stuff. However, through <a href="http://weloveiconfonts.com">We Love Icon Fonts</a> and Twitter I got to know Tim a bit more and as time passed we - and the others - talked daily in our dev chat. It felt super awesome to be around skilled people and I really enjoyed their company.</p>
<p>As I found out that Tim lives near me I wanted to meet him because the only person I ever knew who did web-stuff was my best friend <a href="http://twitter.com/MyXoToD">Max</a> so we drove to Tim&rsquo;s, had some self-made burgers and worked a bit together. That was about 5 months ago and just on Friday I broke up School to work as a full-time Front-End Developer with Tim at <a href="http://synoa.de">Synoa</a>. I&rsquo;m really excited about this!</p>
<p>Tim always said I&rsquo;d be skilled and he&rsquo;d be sure I could create amazing things and I can be - and am willing to - become an awesome web developer. In fact, Tim trusts more in me then I do. Thanks for this at this point.
So, he got me into a Company and wanted to work with me, I accepted and on January 1th 2014 I&rsquo;ll officially start working there. <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a> played a big role in getting me this Job because it&rsquo;s an easy way to show off your skills and an even more easy way to build a Portfolio full of snippets. It took me a lot of time to do different things and while my friends where outside drinking on the weekends I was home doing <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/vtJzn">a CSS classic Gameboy</a>, a <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/IsBka">Vault-Tec Logo</a>, the <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/wAljf">Aperture Science Logo</a>, a <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/jGFCs">turret from Portal</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/BpcGr">R2D2</a> or a single element <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/iqDIv">Link from The Legend Of Zelda</a> - those things are all useless but fun and they helped me a lot in understanding CSS and Sass. I did this to have fun and to have things I could show to others and as I know now it was worth it. I&rsquo;ve got a Job offer and I&rsquo;ll work at a company again.</p>
<p>Getting to know <a href="http://twitter.com/timpietrusky">Tim</a>, using <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel">CodePen</a> that much and <a href="/join-a-dev-group">joining a dev group</a> have been the best decisions I made this year. I am happy and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a full-time working year with a lot of awesome client projects.</p>

      <description>Unreal Engine posted a Video on Vimeo showing Unreal Engine 5 running live on a PlayStation 5.
The demo is truly mind-blowing, especially considering it is running on a console and not on a high-end, custom build PC. I knew the PlayStation 5 and the XBox Series X (or whatever the next XBox is called, horrible naming again from XBox ðŸ™„) are powerful and truly next-gen game changing consoles, but this demo just surprised me with its details.</description>

      <description>If you know me you&amp;rsquo;ll probably know that I am a huge Fallout fan. I absolutely love the games (all of them basically, maybe not Tactics) and I&amp;rsquo;ve played Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas countless times on XBox 360 and PC. When Fallout 76 was announced via a mysterious live stream in anticipation of E3 2018 I spent an entire evening on Twitch watching - nothing. It was a bit frustrating at the time but checking Reddit and Twitter for all kinds of hints as to what this stream could mean and speculation with the amazing r/Fallout community was a lot of fun.</description>

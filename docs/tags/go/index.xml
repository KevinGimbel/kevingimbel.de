First of all it looks different. Second, it is now served over HTTPS which is possible because I moved away from GitHub Pages and back to self-hosting my website. Third, and possible most important, I also moved away from Jekyll after using it for three years.
This very site you read right now is build with Hugo, a static site generator build by Steve Francia, Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen and a lot of contributors.</description></item></channel></rss>

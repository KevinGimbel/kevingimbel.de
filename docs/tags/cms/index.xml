All of these use list templates and render &amp;ldquo;article&amp;rdquo;-like content previews. I wanted to add some content to these lists and Hugo has a special file named _index.md for that. This file can be used to create index pages for lists.
When I did that I somehow also included the index files in the post listings which was not what I wanted, so I added a if statement to my article-preview.</description></item><item><title>Hugo: compare dates to flag old content</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/01/hugo-compare-dates-to-flag-old-content/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2020/01/hugo-compare-dates-to-flag-old-content/</guid><description>With the recent redesign of my website I also wanted to add a note to old articles. The IT world is changing fast and information can quickly be outdated, so I decided to add an automatically generated note to every post that is older than 4 years. Using the Hugo Math function and Date values it can be accomplished in automated-enough fashion.
Partial First I created a new partial named single-header.</description></item><item><title>Bullgit loves Jekyll</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/01/bullgit-loves-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/01/bullgit-loves-jekyll/</guid><description>After having a static HTML Page for about 6 months, we at bullgit just switched to a brand-new Jekyll page that uses the GitHub API to display all our repos as well as a list of members with images and links and there are a few reasons why we made this switch:
Jekyll is built-in GitHub pages Jekyll is easy-to-learn and easy to maintain No-Database handling of Data (see the list of members we use) Everyone can clone the repo and run it locally So basically, as soon as you have a Project on GitHub or an organization like bullgit you can use the power of Jekyll to make your page easy to use and easy to change even for new members.</description></item><item><title>Ghost in the shell</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2013/10/ghost-in-the-shell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2013/10/ghost-in-the-shell/</guid><description>Finally Ghost launched to the public! I waited for this CMS since I first heard of, at this time my blog was running on WordPress which always felt overloaded. WordPress has a lot of functions and stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t need when publishing a few articles a month to the Internet. However, I switched to Jekyll as you may know and now there is Ghost. It felt like it&amp;rsquo;d be my birthday while unpacking the *.</description></item></channel></rss>

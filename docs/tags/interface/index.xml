      <title>Pseudo Product Flags</title>

      <description>For a recent client Project I had to create Product Flags that are displayed at the top of each product. The Flags should have different colors and different values (which also have different lengths). The values are applied via the data Attribute and the colors are also controlled via a data Attribute. The &amp;ldquo;Problem&amp;rdquo; with this task was that it&amp;rsquo;s not only a few different length, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-language system and therefore can end up in a lot of different width of the product flags - a &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; solution, like applying a max-width of let&amp;rsquo;s say 20em, isn&amp;rsquo;t the best solution for this so I ended up creating a flexible solution.</description>

      <description>Today I thought about a project I had in mind for some time, it has to do with ratings of different contents and the first thing I thought about was: What&amp;rsquo;s the easiest or best way to create a rating form with custom buttons (stars, hearts, whatever).
A few years ago I had to do this once and I remember doing it with an image and background-position but as of today I really love pseudo elements and &amp;ldquo;Look-Ma-No-Image!</description>

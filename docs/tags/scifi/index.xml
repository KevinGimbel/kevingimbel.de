Before you continue reading, I want to say that I did not finish the book - I stopped half-way through
The story is not really new or engaging and moves very slowly. The writing style is too detailed for me to form a good image in my mind, every time I have an image of a scene the author adds more and more details and it just keeps changing; It&amp;rsquo;s too much of hard world building for me.</description></item></channel></rss>

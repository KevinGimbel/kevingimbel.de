      <title>Using Archetypes in Hugo</title>

      <description>For the longest time I completely ignored archetypes in hugo. I&amp;rsquo;d always copy over the front-matter from the last blog post I wrote and then fill in the things I needed - leading to some mistakes (e.g. using category instead of categories) over time.
Archetypes are easy to use, for example to create this post I ran the following command
$ hugo new blog/2020-01-07-using-archetypes-in-hugo.md This copied over the archetype file from archetypes/blog.</description>

      <title>Hugo: ignore _index.md in list templates</title>

      <description>While creating my new website I also added more sections, namely a blog, photography, and art section. All of these use list templates and render &amp;ldquo;article&amp;rdquo;-like content previews. I wanted to add some content to these lists and Hugo has a special file named _index.md for that. This file can be used to create index pages for lists.
When I did that I somehow also included the index files in the post listings which was not what I wanted, so I added a if statement to my article-preview.</description>

      <title>Hugo: compare dates to flag old content</title>

      <description>With the recent redesign of my website I also wanted to add a note to old articles. The IT world is changing fast and information can quickly be outdated, so I decided to add an automatically generated note to every post that is older than 4 years. Using the Hugo Math function and Date values it can be accomplished in automated-enough fashion.
Partial First I created a new partial named single-header.</description>

      <title>Bullgit loves Jekyll</title>

      <description>After having a static HTML Page for about 6 months, we at bullgit just switched to a brand-new Jekyll page that uses the GitHub API to display all our repos as well as a list of members with images and links and there are a few reasons why we made this switch:
 Jekyll is built-in GitHub pages Jekyll is easy-to-learn and easy to maintain No-Database handling of Data (see the list of members we use) Everyone can clone the repo and run it locally  So basically, as soon as you have a Project on GitHub or an organization like bullgit you can use the power of Jekyll to make your page easy to use and easy to change even for new members.</description>

Beside the fact I had to create a custom Hugo theme for myself and learn how to run a Hugo blog/website I also had to think about how I am going to deploy my website. Hugo is a static site generator and when executed ($ hugo) it compiles the site from Markdown and HTML templates into a public directory with lots of folders and HTML files.</description></item></channel></rss>

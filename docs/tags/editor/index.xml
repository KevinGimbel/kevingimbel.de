My first impression was - as everyones I guess - pretty bad. VIM is not that easy to understand, yet a powerful, shortcut-based, distraction free editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about turning Sublime Text into VIM mode and my very first VIM impression, but back then I just copy &amp;amp; pasted everything I found on the Internet into my .</description></item><item><title>Noobish VIM</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/07/noobish-vim/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/07/noobish-vim/</guid><description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to really get why so many (Front-End) Devs love VIM I tried to find a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; way to integrate it into my daily workflow. Since I&amp;rsquo;m working in a relativley small company it&amp;rsquo;s most of the time stressy to get all things done and to keep an overview - so long story short: There&amp;rsquo;s not much time for new tools that don&amp;rsquo;t increase my workflow directly. VIM is one of these tools that don&amp;rsquo;t fully support my workflow at the moment.</description></item><item><title>Vim - first impression</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/05/vim-first-impression/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2014/05/vim-first-impression/</guid><description>When I first looked at Vim it was a very short experience that was literally as follows
# from the command line vim test.md *vim opens* &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s that?&amp;#34; *CTRL + C* &amp;#34;How do I even close this?!&amp;#34; *opens browser, googles &amp;#34;how to close VIM&amp;#34;* ESC + :q That was it and that was my Vim experience for quite some time. However, lately I see more and more people talking about Vim being the single best editor for everything - no matter what language one writes.</description></item><item><title>Brackets vs. Sublime Text</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2013/12/brackets-vs.-sublime-text/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2013/12/brackets-vs.-sublime-text/</guid><description>I first tried Brackets back in my Windows time. It was a very early version, kinda heavy and wonky and not what I wanted from an editor I use on a daily base at all. Just today I decided to give it a second look because beside VIM it is the editor I read quite a lot about latly. My first impression was: &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s a simple, clean editor!&amp;rdquo; - exactly the thing I liked so much about Sublime Text 2 which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the last two years or so.</description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>Time sure does fly sometimes! I just realized the last &amp;ldquo;weekly&amp;rdquo; review post was from the beginning of march, namely week 8 and 9, so one month ago. In the meantime I played a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, worked on a Go thing, and went to a concert.

      <description>It turns out that a lot of my time is actually spent working or playing games - so there&#39;s not too much to tell and weekly updates become hard-ish to write. I am going to go with bi-weekly or even monthly updates from now on. So this post is week eight and week nine - week nine being the week the Nintendo Switch and The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were released.</description>

      <description>In week six nothing happened so it was skipped. Quite nice, actually. In the second half of week six and through week seven I prepared a workshop which I gave on Friday at the Coding Night. This Coding Night was a special one: The topic was &amp;ldquo;CodingNight feat. CodeDoor feat. Refugees&amp;rdquo; which was a collaboration between CodingNight and CodeDoor. CodeDoor is a project which teaches Refugees coding skills, how to build projects and how to get a Job in the programming field.</description>

      <description>Another week passed, another personal review. This week I finally got a appointment with my tattoo artist to finish up my tattoo. I&#39;m only 6 months late to do so because I kept saying &amp;ldquo;I&#39;ll call next week&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&#39;ll do it when I&#39;m back from Amsterdam&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&#39;ll do it after Christmas&amp;rdquo; - and so on. I am really bad with managing time and work-life balance. If you have any tips on how you manage the things you have to do, hit me up on twitter @_kevinatari.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s the last week of the first month already - weird how fast time seems to tick! This week has been rather stressful and loaded with work which is why I did not write any posts or did any programming in my free time. Looking back at the week there&#39;s not much to say so this will be a quick read with some reading recommendations at the end.

      <description>Another week another short review! The third week of 2017 had a lot of travel because I attended an Elasticsearch training course in Munich to learn more about Elasticsearch hands-on. The two day course was exiting and I enjoyed my time, learning quite a lot about the different features of Elasticsearch and Kibana. Part of the course material is a 500 page PDF file which is a copy of the presentation held during the two days - I am glad I got it because it&#39;s a great reference to look at.</description>

      <description>This week I spent a lot of time with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and made myself familiar with the backend and the way server / instance management works on AWS. While doing so I also learned that AWS instances are by default not accessible from the internet - they have no open ports and each instance needs a &amp;ldquo;Security Group&amp;rdquo; which defines ways to access the instance. They also do not have Shell access by default.</description>

      <description>German blogger, designer, and YouTuber Marcel Wichmann started a weekly-review blog series which I find quite interesting! Reviewing in short what happened in each week of the year is a nice and &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; way to recap everything that happened - and it also helps writing this years big review post at the end of the year. I am not sure if I&#39;ll keep it up for each week but I will try.</description>

      <title>2016, a short review</title>

      <description>2016 has been an odd year in regards to world events and deaths - quite depressing actually. For me personal it has been the exact opposite. Overall, for me 2016 has been an excellent year.
January   View from the hotel in Fuerteventura.   January started with what we call a &amp;ldquo;Braincamp&amp;rdquo;. A Braincamp is a company trip to a remote location where we at Synoa GmbH take time outside the office and come up with ideas and projects to do for the year.</description>

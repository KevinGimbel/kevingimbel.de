      <description>I recently found a nice and clean way of building and distributing Rust CLI apps using docker.

The tech does not matter much, as we can just create a tiny example &amp;ldquo;app&amp;rdquo; for this blog post.</description>

Deno aims to do better and fix some (or all?</description>

      <description>I first tried Brackets back in my Windows time. It was a very early version, kinda heavy and wonky and not what I wanted from an editor I use on a daily base at all. Just today I decided to give it a second look because beside VIM it is the editor I read quite a lot about latly. My first impression was: &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&#39;s a simple, clean editor!&amp;rdquo; - exactly the thing I liked so much about Sublime Text 2 which I&#39;ve been using for the last two years or so.</description>

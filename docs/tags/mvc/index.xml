      <description>The other day I had a kind of easy problem in Magento that still took me quite some time to solve. In the shop I&#39;m working on we had a contact form module that sents and validates emails which worked perfectly fine on one page (the one it was made for), however this form should be &amp;ldquo;cloned&amp;rdquo; to be present on 4 pages with different email addresses. Since Magentos Core is MVC-like I believed there would be an easy way to pass email addresses to the Controller.</description>

Absolutely loved this show! It&amp;rsquo;s a good hour of laughing with serious topics wrapped into jokes, but never feels too uncomfortable.
From the topics and the overall feeling it&amp;rsquo;s not as hard as Nanette, which just left me sobbing during the last half and was a constant rollercoaster because it is very harsh and real and touches a lot of very personal topics; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil - just take an hour and watch it on Netflix.</description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>I first tried Brackets back in my Windows time. It was a very early version, kinda heavy and wonky and not what I wanted from an editor I use on a daily base at all. Just today I decided to give it a second look because beside VIM it is the editor I read quite a lot about latly. My first impression was: &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s a simple, clean editor!&amp;rdquo; - exactly the thing I liked so much about Sublime Text 2 which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the last two years or so.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a Front-End Developer you may have already heard about Pre-Processors such as Sass, LESS or Stylus. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that they&amp;rsquo;re all good and which one you use is up to you or your team. I prefer Sass with the SCSS Syntax (= keeps semicolons and brackets).
Even though Pre-Processors are easy to use and setup some people are still confused: Do I have to run them on a server?</description>

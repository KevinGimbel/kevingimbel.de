      <description>If you know me you&#39;ll probably know that I am a huge Fallout fan. I absolutely love the games (all of them basically, maybe not Tactics) and I&#39;ve played Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas countless times on XBox 360 and PC. When Fallout 76 was announced via a mysterious live stream in anticipation of E3 2018 I spent an entire evening on Twitch watching - nothing. It was a bit frustrating at the time but checking Reddit and Twitter for all kinds of hints as to what this stream could mean and speculation with the amazing r/Fallout community was a lot of fun.</description>

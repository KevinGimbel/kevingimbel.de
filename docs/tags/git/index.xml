      <description>Ever found yourself needing that one fix from a PR on GitHub that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet? How can you get the code, for example a Magento fix, into your code base? Copy-paste it? That might work for small changes, but for large and complex changes copy-pasting is no solution. Luckily, we can use GitHub to generate a patch file, which can then be applied with either the git or patch command.</description>

      <description>If you follow my blog you might recall that I switched from Jekyll hosted on GitHub to Hugo hosted on Uberspace. Beside the fact I had to create a custom Hugo theme for myself and learn how to run a Hugo blog/website I also had to think about how I am going to deploy my website. Hugo is a static site generator and when executed ($ hugo) it compiles the site from Markdown and HTML templates into a public directory with lots of folders and HTML files.</description>

      <description>Die Linke Hand der Dunkelheit   &amp;ldquo;Die linke Hand der Dunkelheit&amp;rdquo; von Ursula K. Le Guin war schon eine ganze Weile auf meiner langen Liste der (retro) Sci-Fi Bücher die ich noch lesen möchte. Ich habe es vor einiger Zeit auf Reddit in einer &amp;ldquo;Must-Read&amp;rdquo; Liste gesehen und fand den Klappentext sehr ansprechend, Zitat:
 Die Bewohner des Planeten Gethen sind uns Menschen verblüffend ähnlich - mit einem Unterschied: Sie kennen keine zwei Geschlechter.</description>

      <description>Last night my wife and I watched Hannah Gadsbys newest stand-up show called &amp;ldquo;Douglas&amp;rdquo; and within the first minute I was out of breath and laughing because she just hits my humor spot on. Absolutely loved this show! It&amp;rsquo;s a good hour of laughing with serious topics wrapped into jokes, but never feels too uncomfortable.
From the topics and the overall feeling it&amp;rsquo;s not as hard as Nanette, which just left me sobbing during the last half and was a constant rollercoaster because it is very harsh and real and touches a lot of very personal topics; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil - just take an hour and watch it on Netflix.</description>

      <title>Lord of Souls</title>

      <description>Similar to The Infernal City, I also had Lord of Souls by Greg Keyes standing in my bookshelf for years, and after finishing and loving &amp;ldquo;The Infernal City&amp;rdquo; I was very excited to continue the journey with Lord of Souls.
The two books connect seamlessly and Lord of Souls finishes the storylines which all somewhat interconnect at the end. From first to last page it is incredibly exciting and expends the lore of Umbriel, the floating city that kills everything below it just to raise the corpse as an undead army that marches towards the Imperial City.</description>

      <description>I finally came around to read The Infernal City by Greg Keys. As a huge fan of Elder Scrolls I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to read this book in a long time and in fact had it in my bookshelf for the past 3-4ish years, but I just never took the time to read it.
I absolutely absorbed this book and loved it front to back! It fits quite well into the lore and doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; or wrong.</description>

      <title>Fall Guys</title>

      <description>Fall Guys is fun! It&amp;rsquo;s stupid and fun, and I love it. It&amp;rsquo;s like someone turned Takeshi&amp;rsquo;s Castle into a video game. You run around parkours with 60 other people, all controlling one of the little blobby-folks seen in the screenshots. There&amp;rsquo;s costumes and multiple rounds, some rounds are team-based like playing soccer with a huge ball, other rounds are all-vs-all.
In general, I enjoyed playing. I played for about an hour last night, and while I had fun I don&amp;rsquo;t really see me playing a lot more since I only have a limited amount of time to play video games and I&amp;rsquo;d rather play Elder Scrolls: Online or Valorant with friends than Fall Guys, but I guess if you just want to play something without thinking too much Fall Guys is your game.</description>

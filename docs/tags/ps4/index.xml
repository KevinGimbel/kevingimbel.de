      <description>Fall Guys is fun! It&amp;rsquo;s stupid and fun, and I love it. It&amp;rsquo;s like someone turned Takeshi&amp;rsquo;s Castle into a video game. You run around parkours with 60 other people, all controlling one of the little blobby-folks seen in the screenshots. There&amp;rsquo;s costumes and multiple rounds, some rounds are team-based like playing soccer with a huge ball, other rounds are all-vs-all.
In general, I enjoyed playing. I played for about an hour last night, and while I had fun I don&amp;rsquo;t really see me playing a lot more since I only have a limited amount of time to play video games and I&amp;rsquo;d rather play Elder Scrolls: Online or Valorant with friends than Fall Guys, but I guess if you just want to play something without thinking too much Fall Guys is your game.</description>

      <description>Lately I had a hard time working with my own website. Whenever I wanted to make some updates, write a post or fix a little buggy thing it only took a few minutes of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to get me really frustrated. Jekyll, despite my love for it, has become horribly slow. My site, which I consider rather &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo;, took 17-20 seconds to build on every change! Changing the CSS? Rebuild entire site.</description>

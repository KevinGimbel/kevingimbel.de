I actually liked this one a lot, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a bit too close. Shot with my old Canon EOS 1000D and 50mm/f1.8 lense.
I was very surprised by the quality of this image. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t use my Canon EOS 1000D much because images tent to have a lot of noise and too much red - which is fine since I&amp;rsquo;ve taken probably close to 100.</description></item><item><title>Fasanerie</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/photography/2019/10/fasanerie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/photography/2019/10/fasanerie/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Fasanerie&amp;rdquo; is the name of a local wildlife and forest park. It&amp;rsquo;s free to enter and a very nice place to spent a family day.

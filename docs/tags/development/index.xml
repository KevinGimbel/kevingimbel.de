      <description>Christmas came earlier this year! Since my co-workers switched to MacBooks over the year I got a MacBook, too. I got my new PC last year so I was not due to a hardware change for at least another year but - to my luck - I also got a new PC so we all have the same hardware. After three years of Ubuntu and Linux/GNU it&#39;s odd to switch to MacOS.</description>

      <title>Gotcha: dockerignore</title>

      <description>Today I was caught off-guard by a docker &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; - or so I thought at first. I tried to boot up a project with docker-compose up like I do since switching to a Mac. Unusual was that docker-compose stopped at the build step and would not finish the boot. After some confusion and after checking the projects docker-compose.yml configuration file I went to GitHub to see the newest docker for mac issues because I was using the beta release and thought a recent update might broke a thing or two.</description>

      <description>If you have visited my website in the past few weeks you might have notices a few things. First of all it looks different. Second, it is now served over HTTPS which is possible because I moved away from GitHub Pages and back to self-hosting my website. Third, and possible most important, I also moved away from Jekyll after using it for three years.
This very site you read right now is build with Hugo, a static site generator build by Steve Francia, Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen and a lot of contributors.</description>

      <title>Speed up your Jekyll workflow</title>

      <description>Lately I had a hard time working with my own website. Whenever I wanted to make some updates, write a post or fix a little buggy thing it only took a few minutes of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to get me really frustrated. Jekyll, despite my love for it, has become horribly slow. My site, which I consider rather &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo;, took 17-20 seconds to build on every change! Changing the CSS? Rebuild entire site.</description>

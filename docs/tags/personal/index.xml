I completly re-wrote the Front-End and created a new theme with a focus on accessibility and well-structured content. On the web, Accessibility is enabled by default; All you need is a good HTML structure and your website is almost ready to go! A second important part of accessibility is color and contrast as well as font sizing. I decided to let users choose their own color scheme, font-size, and dark or light mode - all done with CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS variables).</description></item><item><title>2017, week 10, 11, 12, 13</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/04/2017-week-10-11-12-13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 13:34:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/04/2017-week-10-11-12-13/</guid><description>Time sure does fly sometimes! I just realized the last &amp;ldquo;weekly&amp;rdquo; review post was from the beginning of march, namely week 8 and 9, so one month ago. In the meantime I played a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, worked on a Go thing, and went to a concert.

I am going to go with bi-weekly or even monthly updates from now on. So this post is week eight and week nine - week nine being the week the Nintendo Switch and The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were released.</description></item><item><title>2017, week seven</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/02/2017-week-seven/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2017 14:03:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/02/2017-week-seven/</guid><description>In week six nothing happened so it was skipped. Quite nice, actually. In the second half of week six and through week seven I prepared a workshop which I gave on Friday at the Coding Night. This Coding Night was a special one: The topic was &amp;ldquo;CodingNight feat. CodeDoor feat. Refugees&amp;rdquo; which was a collaboration between CodingNight and CodeDoor. CodeDoor is a project which teaches Refugees coding skills, how to build projects and how to get a Job in the programming field.</description></item><item><title>2017, week five</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/02/2017-week-five/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 08:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/02/2017-week-five/</guid><description>Another week passed, another personal review. This week I finally got a appointment with my tattoo artist to finish up my tattoo. I&amp;rsquo;m only 6 months late to do so because I kept saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll call next week&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it when I&amp;rsquo;m back from Amsterdam&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it after Christmas&amp;rdquo; - and so on. I am really bad with managing time and work-life balance. If you have any tips on how you manage the things you have to do, hit me up on twitter @_kevinatari.</description></item><item><title>2017, week four</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-four/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 12:44:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-four/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of the first month already - weird how fast time seems to tick! This week has been rather stressful and loaded with work which is why I did not write any posts or did any programming in my free time. Looking back at the week there&amp;rsquo;s not much to say so this will be a quick read with some reading recommendations at the end.

The third week of 2017 had a lot of travel because I attended an Elasticsearch training course in Munich to learn more about Elasticsearch hands-on. The two day course was exiting and I enjoyed my time, learning quite a lot about the different features of Elasticsearch and Kibana. Part of the course material is a 500 page PDF file which is a copy of the presentation held during the two days - I am glad I got it because it&amp;rsquo;s a great reference to look at.</description></item><item><title>2017, week two</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-two/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 17:05:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-two/</guid><description>This week I spent a lot of time with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and made myself familiar with the backend and the way server / instance management works on AWS. While doing so I also learned that AWS instances are by default not accessible from the internet - they have no open ports and each instance needs a &amp;ldquo;Security Group&amp;rdquo; which defines ways to access the instance. They also do not have Shell access by default.</description></item><item><title>2017, week one</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-one/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 18:02:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2017-week-one/</guid><description>German blogger, designer, and YouTuber Marcel Wichmann started a weekly-review blog series which I find quite interesting! Reviewing in short what happened in each week of the year is a nice and &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; way to recap everything that happened - and it also helps writing this years big review post at the end of the year. I am not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it up for each week but I will try.</description></item><item><title>2016, a short review</title><link>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2016-a-short-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 14:37:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kevingimbel.de/blog/2017/01/2016-a-short-review/</guid><description>2016 has been an odd year in regards to world events and deaths - quite depressing actually. For me personal it has been the exact opposite. Overall, for me 2016 has been an excellent year.

First of all it looks different. Second, it is now served over HTTPS which is possible because I moved away from GitHub Pages and back to self-hosting my website. Third, and possible most important, I also moved away from Jekyll after using it for three years.
This very site you read right now is build with Hugo, a static site generator build by Steve Francia, Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen and a lot of contributors.</description></item></channel></rss>

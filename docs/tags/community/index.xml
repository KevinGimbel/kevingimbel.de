It was the best decision I made this year and I want to tell you why. After doing more experiments on CodePen and right after I got to know Tim Pietrusky he opened a tlk.io Chat called #CodePen. For those who&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with tlk: it&amp;rsquo;s an open web chat. You can create a room, everyone can join and all things are open to everyone who knows the URL.</description></item></channel></rss>

Yesterday I got my [Keychron K2 keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)! It's my first time getting a mechanical keyboard and also the first time using an ANSI layout instead of the german ISO layout. It's also the first time using such a small keyboard so I'll need to get used to the position of keys again, especially since I am not typing with 10 fingers (tho I should really learn to!).

I'll need a few weeks before I can give a review but so far I am very happy.  At this point huge **thank you** to my employer [Synoa GmbH](https://synoa.de/) who payed for it! Want a new Keychron and a MacBook Pro, too? We are [hiring Senior Java Devs](https://synoa.de/ueber-uns/jobs/)!

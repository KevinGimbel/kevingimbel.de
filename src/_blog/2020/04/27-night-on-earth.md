Last weekend I finished "[Night on Earth](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80218938 "View Night On Earth on Netflix.com")" a Netflix documentation about animal life during the night, filmed with super light sensitive cameras making the darkest night look like early evening; It's an interesting look into the night and quite entertaining and educating. 

You can find the documentation [here on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80218938 "View Night On Earth on Netflix.com")

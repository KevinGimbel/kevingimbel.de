Fall Guys is fun! It's stupid and fun, and I love it. It's like [someone turned Takeshi's Castle into a video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle). You run around parkours with 60 other people, all controlling one of the little blobby-folks seen in the screenshots. There's costumes and multiple rounds, some rounds are team-based like playing soccer with a huge ball, other rounds are all-vs-all. 

In general, I enjoyed playing. I played for about an hour last night, and while I had fun I don't really see me playing a lot more since I only have a limited amount of time to play video games and I'd rather play [Elder Scrolls: Online](https://elderscrollsonline.com) or [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com) with friends than Fall Guys, but I guess if you just want to play something without thinking too much Fall Guys is your game. 

You can get Fall Guys on [PS4](https://www.playstation.com/de-de/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-ps4/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/). I played on PS4 and got the game free with my PlayStation Plus subscription.

## Update

I previously rated Fall Guys with 3 stars, but I actually played a lot of it with my wife and kids and we're really into it now. Playing Fall Guys with my wife is a lot of fun and we're celebrating every win and laughing about every lost round together. Good times, 7/5.

Another week another short review! The third week of 2017 had a lot of travel because I attended an [Elasticsearch](https://elastic.co) training course in Munich to learn more about Elasticsearch hands-on. The two day course was exiting and I enjoyed my time, learning quite a lot about the different features of Elasticsearch and Kibana. Part of the course material is a 500 page PDF file which is a copy of the presentation held during the two days - I am glad I got it because it's a great reference to look at.

### Munich

{% figure "/images/posts/2017/week-three/snow-covered-bicycle-munich.jpg", "Snow covered bicycle in Munich." %}

Munich was cold with -7°C to -10°C and there was a lot of snow - for a few days it was nice but I'm happy to be back in the middle of Germany without snow. I stayed at [an Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/197005) because all hotels around the city were booked due to a big conference in town. If you want to visit Munich check out the above room - it's great!

During my trip to and from Munich I also had to work at a Starbucks and on the train. Both places are not perfect for working if you're used to a second monitor and having space around you. Starbucks was also really loud which can get annoying - good thing there's music! What helped me tremendously was the MacBook battery life. I can get an average of 8-10 hours of battery life which is simply astonishing.

### Open source

I also helped [track down a bug](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2946) with Gulp and hugo, and then decided to tweet what I have been doing for the past two month: [Following an open source project](https://twitter.com/_kevinatari/status/821773139617218562)

Following an open source project is quite interesting. I read a lot of the hugo issue reports and look at the Pull Requests submitted. This helps me see how to handle pull requests and open source and in my opinion [the hugo project](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) is a good example.

### Star Trek

I finished The Original Series and now started to watch The Next Generation. It's the first time I watch everything in the correct order and I'm exited!

I also programmed a bit and build a text to 1337speak converter [node module](https://github.com/kevingimbel/leetscript) and a [cli tool](https://github.com/kevingimbel/leetscript-cli) which uses the first module. I'm not yet sure why you would need this type of one-way converter but it was an interesting task to build a node module, publish it, and then use it in a script - I'll try and wrap it up in a post.

I also wrote a blog post about [deploying a site with git](/deploy-a-static-site-with-git/) - which is what I am doing with my website at the moment.

### Not On Tour

On Friday I saw [Not On Tour](https://notontour.bandcamp.com/) live with my girlfriend. Not On Tour is a Punk / Hardcore Punk Band from Tel Aviv and I loved every bit of the concerts. The concert was in a small venue with around 50-100 people and they sounded a bit harder live then I expected - and a lot more powerful. I would recommend seeing them live whenever you get a chance.

### Links

Here are some interesting things from this week:

[All Fallout Intros, 1997-2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTD-FJVY9rE) - seeing all the intros to one of my favorite game series is great.

[Yes, science is political](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14258474/trump-inauguration-science-politics-climate-change-vaccines) - The Verge on why science is political and how science and politics play together. A sad read in the upcome of "Trumps America".

[Bits, Bytes, Building With Binary](https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa#.3n5g6mfdr) by [Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/@vaidehijoshi) - a post about bits and bytes and how they work. Vaidehi started a series called [basecs](https://medium.com/basecs) which aims to explain how computers actually work. I highly recommend reading it!

[What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs To Know About Encodings And Character Sets To Work With Text](http://kunststube.net/encoding/) by David Zentgraf - an interesting read about handling encoding and how encoding works.

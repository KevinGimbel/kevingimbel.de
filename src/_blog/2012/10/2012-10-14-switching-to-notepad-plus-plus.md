I decided to use this small blog for any personal thing I think needs to be documented. Well, some weeks ago I decided to switch from Adobe Dreamweaver to Notepad++ for all webstuff I create. Some reasons are:

1. it's faster
2. the whole software is smaller
3. the syntax highlighting is better
4. the general workflow is better
5. it's not overloaded with tiny "macro-buttons"
6. i can close the program with a lot of files opened and they'll be automatically reloaded when I restart notepad++
7. it's free - go try it
8. I feel much better using this software. I love it.

While playing Sea of Thieves and unloading cargo in a port, two random guys came swimming from the open sea shouting "Don't shoot, don't shoot", then entered our ship, and started drinking and dancing. After a few minutes of us dancing together, they entered the canons and shot themselves off into the sea.

Such a beautiful and weird game!

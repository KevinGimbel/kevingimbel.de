I just finished reading "The Electric State" by Simon St√•lenhag and I think it is the first graphic novel I've ever read. I really liked the mood and the writing style. It's not that long, 143 pages with about half of them being beautifully eery images of a dystopian USA.

The images mixed with the short texts on each page tell the story of a young women and a robot traveling together through a almost post-apocalyptic landscape, slowly unraveling hat happened to the world and to the protagonist.

I won't spoil the story of course. I can recommend the book and I'm looking forward to read the other two graphic novels by Simon St√•lenhag: _Tales from the Loop_ and _Things from the Flood_.

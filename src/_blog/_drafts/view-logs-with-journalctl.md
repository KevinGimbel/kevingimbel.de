When running any sort of software on a server there's a high chance you'll find yourself looking at logs to figure out why something isn't working. Logs are usually stored in `/var/log/` or sometimes in the application root, e.g. `/var/www/html/var/logs` or similar for web applications. Finding the right directory for logs can be annoying and tiresome, so today we will look at a another way to view logs on Linux systems: `journalctl`.

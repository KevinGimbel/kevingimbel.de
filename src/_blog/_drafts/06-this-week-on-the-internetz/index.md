## Tech

{% quotefm "https://www.theguardian.com/info/2021/jan/26/how-we-made-typerighter-the-guardians-style-guide-checker" %}
Led across the office by our product manager David Blishen, we peered over Max’s shoulder at the litany of corrections his regexes had picked up. There were lots. Somebody asked Max how many rules he’d written. “Oh”, he said. “About 13,000.”
{% endquotefm %}

The Guardian details how they implemented "[Typerighter](https://github.com/guardian/typerighter)" a tool to enforce writing rules. The tool is open source and has a plugin for [prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/), the web-based editor The Guardian is using.

## Everything else

- I discovered the great [Blogroll](https://mxb.dev/blogroll/) by Max Böck ([@mxbck](https://twitter.com/mxbck)). Been some time since I've seen one and I'm in for it!
- Also from Max, I discovered [The Whimsical Club](https://whimsical.club/), a website collecting fun personal websites that don't take themselves too serious. There's some good and creative stuff in there!

Hello unknown reader,

my name is **Kevin Gimbel** and you've reached my corner of the world wide web. ðŸ‘´

I'm actually not that old tho, I'm in my late twenties and I somehow ended up in the world of (cloud) computing. I'm interested in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) (_a safe and fast programming language_), Sci-Fi, dystopia books, fantasy worlds (_Divinity, Elder Scrolls, Dungeons & Dragons_), and video and boardgames.

I tent to start a lot of things and pursue a lot of different interests when I'm in a rush, but usually not much of it stays with me; Over the past year I briefly started manufacturing solid perfumes, for example. I usually always have something to do, be it a side-project or family life; Somethings's always up.

I love reading books but I never take enough time for it and so it happens that I read multiple books "at the same time" over a year or more. Self care may not be my strong suite, tho it is incredibly important.

You may catch me on [Twitter @kevingimbel](https://twitter.com/kevingimbel).

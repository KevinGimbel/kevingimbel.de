This page lists tools, apps, services, hardware, and other stuff I use in no particular order. All things listed are **honest and personal recommendations**!

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my go-to editor for all development (Rust, web dev, bash scripting, Terraform, Ansible, ...)
- [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) is my monospace font in Visual Studio Code
- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) is my terminal
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) is my shell

## Browser

- [Brave](https://brave.com/) is my day-to-day browser. 

It's build on Chromium and offers Brave Rewards, which is a way to earn the BAT crypto currency by viewing ads. You can directly support me by tipping BAT to this website, my [Twitter @KevinGimbel](https://twitter.com/kevingimbel) or on [GitHub @KevinGimbel](https://github.com/kevingimbel/)!

## Backups

* I backup my entire Mac using Time Machine and a 1TB Seagate hard drive
* I use [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.org/) for cross-device sync of personal files (photos, documents, etc.)

## Security

* [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) is my password manager on macOS
* [Keepass2Android](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android) is my password manager on Android
* [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP) is my Two-Factor Auth token generator 

I wrote about my [2FA and Password Manager setup](/blog/2020/01/two-factor-auth-password-managers-and-cloud-sync/) in the past.

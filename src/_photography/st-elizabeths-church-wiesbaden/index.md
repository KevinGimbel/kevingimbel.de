One of the sightseeing spots in [Wiesbaden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiesbaden) is [St. Elizabeths Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elizabeth%27s_Church,_Wiesbaden), a orthodox church located on top the [Neroberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neroberg).

I'm looking forward to taking some better photos of it in the future.

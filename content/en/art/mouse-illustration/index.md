{{< figure src="v2_with_giraffe.png" alt="Illustration of a mouse with a giraffe in hands" >}}

I made this illustration for my son to hang up in his room. Feel free to print it out for your kids, too if you want! The illustration files are also available in two formats and can be downloaded from the links below:

- [Sketch](kevingimbel_mouse.sketch)
- [SVG](kevingimbel_mouse.svg)

It appears that the SVG has different border rendering settings so borders are not inset. You may need to clean it up a bit.

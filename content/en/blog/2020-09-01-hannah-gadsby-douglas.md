Last night my wife and I watched [Hannah Gadsbys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Gadsby "Hannah Gadsby on Wikipedia") newest stand-up show called "[Douglas](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/81054700 "Watch Douglas on Netflix")" and within the first minute I was out of breath and laughing because she just hits my humor spot on. Absolutely loved this show! It's a good hour of laughing with serious topics wrapped into jokes, but never feels too uncomfortable.

From the topics and the overall feeling it's not as hard as [Nanette](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80233611 "Watch Nanette on Netflix"), which just left me sobbing during the last half and was a constant rollercoaster because it is very harsh and real and touches a lot of very personal topics; If you haven't watched it I don't want to spoil - just take an hour and watch it on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80233611 "Watch Nanette on Netflix"). Everybody should watch this program.

Anyway, _Douglas_ is a solid 5/5 for me!

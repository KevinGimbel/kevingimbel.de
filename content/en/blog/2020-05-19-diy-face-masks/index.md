In light of COVID-19 and the resulting changes to public life I decided to take up a needle and sew some face masks! It's actually fun to do and I wouldn't have thought that I could actually do it! 

I got the layout from [Nina](https://oddnina.de/diy/2020/03/16/gesichtsmasken-anleitung.html) (German blog post), who in turn got it from [Jess Dang's Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUasSmReIVo&t=315s) (English video). Jess' masks look way better and cleaner than mine, but for my first few tries I'm incredibly happy with how they turned out.

I decided to make them slightly bigger than the layout I got ([Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GQkPmh7-AbuPt4DV8JxbT3KavAM4x0-c/view)) because I felt the original size didn't cover my face as much as I liked. 

The comic one is the latest I made, here I used some small rubber bands to hold it up, all other masks use hair ties.

Materials:
- Cotton fabric (I used old t-shirts and one store bought fabric (the comic one))
- Hair ties (cut open, then sewed into the sides)
- Thread and needle
- Lots of time

I've made them all by hand without a sewing machine, which slows down the process if you're not used to sewing. It takes me about 3-4 hours to make one mask, if you're more experienced it probably takes a lot less!

I'm very much in favor of wearing masks and I'm glad it is enforced in stores here in Germany. I think it's a good balance between keeping things "normal" and slowing down the spreading of COVID-19. I'm still staying home as much as possible, which is incredibly easy for me because I'm working from home (and have worked from home for the past 6+ years); I know not everybody has this privilege and I'm thankful for everyone that is doing their part - thanks! 

If you think masks are a way of censorship you can fuck off. :) 

Below you can find a gallery of some of the masks I made, I'm planning on doing more over the next weeks.

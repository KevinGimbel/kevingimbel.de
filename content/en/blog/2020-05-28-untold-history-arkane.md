_"The Untold History of Arkane: Dishonored / Prey / Ravenholm / LMNO / The Crossing"_ is a documentation by NoClip about Arkane Studios, one of my absolute favorite game studios! Lately they gained popularity with daring AAA games like Dishonored and Prey. This documentation explores the 20 years of history that made Arkane what they are today and contains never seen footage of a Half-Life Game developed by Arkane which got cancelled.

You can view the full documentation [for free on YouTube](https://youtu.be/h4kdqwdbZZ8) and support Noclip on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/noclip).

Fall Guys is fun! It's stupid and fun, and I love it. It's like [someone turned Takeshi's Castle into a video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle). You run around parkours with 60 other people, all controlling one of the little blobby-folks seen in the screenshots. There's costumes and multiple rounds, some rounds are team-based like playing soccer with a huge ball, other rounds are all-vs-all. 

In general, I enjoyed playing. I played for about an hour last night, and while I had fun I don't really see me playing a lot more since I only have a limited amount of time to play video games and I'd rather play [Elder Scrolls: Online](https://elderscrollsonline.com) or [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com) with friends than Fall Guys, but I guess if you just want to play something without thinking too much Fall Guys is your game.

Similar to [The Infernal City]({{< ref "blog/2020-08-16-greg-keyes-the-infernal-city/index.md" >}}), I also had Lord of Souls by Greg Keyes standing in my bookshelf for years, and after finishing and loving "The Infernal City" I was very excited to continue the journey with Lord of Souls.

The two books connect seamlessly and Lord of Souls finishes the storylines which all somewhat interconnect at the end. From first to last page it is incredibly exciting and expends the lore of Umbriel, the floating city that kills everything below it just to raise the corpse as an undead army that marches towards the Imperial City. 

Just as The Infernal City, I loved this book and I recommend it for everybody that's interested in Elder Scrolls lore beyond the games.

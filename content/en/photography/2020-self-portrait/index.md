The other day I had to wait for some code to deploy so I grabbed my camera and took a few self portraits. I actually liked this one a lot, even if it's a bit too close. Shot with my old Canon EOS 1000D and 50mm/f1.8 lense.

I was very surprised by the quality of this image. I usually don't use my Canon EOS 1000D much because images tent to have a lot of noise and too much red - which is fine since I've taken probably close to 100.000 pictures with it. Anyway, I usually prefer my [Fujifulim X30](/tags/fujifilm_x30 "View photos taken with my Fujifilm X30") but its lens is no comparison to the Canon 50mm/f1.8, which is just better suited for portraits.

Images were shot in RAW format and then edited with [Darktable](https://darktable.org/).

I first discovered the [Theater car park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.08321/8.24763 "Location on OpenStreetMap") some months ago when having a walk through [Warmer Damm](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/24202797 "Warmer Damm park on OpenStreetMaps") and wanted to photograph it ever since. Sadly, I often forget to take my camera when I leave the house and so it took a while until I finally thought of taking it.

I'm quite pleased with the result, you can find an unedited version on my [Instagram @kevingimbel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGe-W7glW8I/).

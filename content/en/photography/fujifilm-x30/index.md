A picture of my Fujifilm X30, taken with an iPhone in low light and not edited. I kinda liked the result.

Right now the Fujifilm X30 is my main camera which I try to carry with me at all times. It's a great camera for quick snapshots and day-to-day photography. I'm thinking about getting another camera with switchable lenses, but I cannot decide on one. It'll probably be either a Fujifilm X-T2 or Canon EOS 5D Mark 2 - right now I have a strong preference for the Fujifilm.

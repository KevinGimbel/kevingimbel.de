"[Fasanerie](https://fasanerie.net/ "Website of FÃ¶rderverein Fasanerie e.V.")" is the name of a local wildlife and forest park. It's free to enter and a very nice place to spent a family day.

All images were edited with [Darktable](https://darktable.org/ "darktable is an open source photography workflow application and raw developer"), a free open source Adobe Lightroom alternative.

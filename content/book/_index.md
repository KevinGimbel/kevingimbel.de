I'm a slow reader. That's a sad fact and that is what makes me read books for literal months. I sometimes start a book, read a bit, stop reading for weeks, then pick it up again. 

I'm very actively trying to change this and "force" myself to read more, for example reading on the train instead of playing Switch or aimlessly browsing on my phone. It's kind of working, and I'm hoping I'll read more books in the years to come.

### Ratings

You may find ratings behind each book, e.g. `(4/5â­‘)` means 4 out of 5 stars, so I liked this book.

### Languages

The book titles are German and English mixed because I have read some books in German and some in English (a few even in German and English). 

**Note:** This section is still being put together, not all books have been added yet and since I never recorded this data anywhere I need to go through my bookshelf and Amazon orders to find all the books I've read.

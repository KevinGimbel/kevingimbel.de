It's the last week of the first month already - weird how fast time seems to tick! This week has been rather stressful and loaded with work which is why I did not write any posts or did any programming in my free time. Looking back at the week there's not much to say so this will be a quick read with some reading recommendations at the end.

### `dep`

The Go language has released a alpha version of [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) - their dependency management tool. Up until now there was no native suport for dependency management in Go. Go provides an `import` functionality to load packages. The `import` mechanism is similar to the NodeJS `require` - with the big difference that it used to store all packages inside the `$GOPATH` - a directory on the system where all packages from all go code is stored. With the new `dep` dependency manager dependencies will be stored inside a `vendor` directory inside the package directory - similar to `node_modules`.

I started playing around with the alpha release and will write a article about it once I gathered enough information.

### Crypt of the Necrodancer

{{< youtube -HiQUw5Np8o >}}

My best friend showed me [Crypt of the NecroDancer](http://necrodancer.com/), a rhythmic, rouge-like, dungeon crawler where you dance your way deep into a dungeon. It's beautiful. Weird, and beautiful. You have to stay in the rhythm to move around and attack enemies. The more you stay in rhythm the better your score gets. Typical for rouge-like games when you die you need to start over. I only played for an hour or so but look forward to continue it. It's more casual which is what I need - or want - to play at the moment. I bought it for PlayStation 4 but its also available on PS Vita, Mac, PC, and iOS.

### Antilopen Gang

I bought tickets for [Antilopen Gang](http://www.schlachthof-wiesbaden.de/programmdetails/items/antilopen-gang-anarchie-alltag.html). Antilopen Gang is german Hip Hop - and Punk, at least on their latest album ["Anarchie und Alltag"](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bl6aukayea54w6hm757vx2npv3m?t=Anarchie_und_Alltag__Bonusalbum_Atombombe_auf_Deutschland_-_Antilopen_Gang). I am looking forward to the concert!

### Things to read

["This browser tweak saved 60% of requests to Facebook"](https://code.facebook.com/posts/557147474482256/this-browser-tweak-saved-60-of-requests-to-facebook) - how Facebook worked with browser vendors to tweak the browser cache, effectively saving 60% of requests to Servers.

["Here‚Äôs how underground chemist Tim Scully planned to save the world with LSD"](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14398934/tim-scully-lsd-chemistry-drugs-counterculture-psychedelics) the Story of Tim Scully who produced LSD in the 60s in underground labs. It's an interesting read into the world of psychedelics and LSD production - which appears to be really hard.

I made a [Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/825722790259126273) with some tweets I found interesting. Most tweets are political and represents feedback to Trumps shit show. It's horrible how much he fucked up in just one week - stay anti, USA! üè¥

That's it for week four. Next week I will help my girlfriend move to her new flat and hopefully finally get to my tattoo artist so we can arrange a session to finish up my tattoo - which is long overdue.

A few days ago I made my own Iced Tea and I thought I'd share this quick 'n easy recipe on the blog.

{{< left is_html="true" >}}
<h3>Ingredients for 1 liter</h3>
<ul>
<li>Half a lemon</li>
<li>A  bit of Agave syrup (1-2 table spoon)</li>
<li>300ml fresh brewed black tea (I used a cheap Earl Grey)</li>
<li>700ml water (I used with gas, can also be without!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Boil water and make black tea, let it sit for longer, we need it to be strong (~10-15min)</li>
<li>Cut lemon and squeeze out juice</li>
<li>Mix lemon and Black Tea, e.g. directly into a bottle</li>
<li>Fill-up with water</li>
<li>Add Agave syrup</li>
</ol>

I left mine in the fridge to let it cool off until the next day. As a bottle I used an old Club Mate Bottle, I usually keep a few of them around for DIY drinks. Hope you enjoy! üçµü•∂

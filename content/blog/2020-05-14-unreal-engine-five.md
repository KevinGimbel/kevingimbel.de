Unreal Engine posted a [Video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/417882964 "View Unreal Engine 5 demo video") showing Unreal Engine 5 running live on a PlayStation 5.

The demo is truly mind-blowing, especially considering it is running on a console and not on a high-end, custom build PC. I knew the PlayStation 5 and the XBox Series X (or whatever the next XBox is called, horrible naming again from XBox ðŸ™„) are powerful and truly next-gen game changing consoles, but this demo just surprised me with its details.

If you can then watch it in 4K.

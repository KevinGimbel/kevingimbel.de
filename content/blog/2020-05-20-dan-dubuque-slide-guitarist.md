I just discovered [Dan Dubuque's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDByT6Y7bS9hQI2Po38cHg/) because the video ["Dan Dubuque covering RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE's "Killing In The Name Of" on Weissenborn Slide Guitar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVboY26AexU) caught my attention. First off, I love Rage Against The Machine, and second what the fuck is a [Slide Guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_guitar "View Slide Guitar Wikipedia article")? While I know the sound of it, I've never heard the name before. The cover is really good and the channel seems to be new (only one month old). I've subscribed and I'm looking forward to more videos!

Some of my favorites so far: 

- ["Dan Dubuque covering RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE's "Killing In The Name Of" on Weissenborn Slide Guitar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVboY26AexU)
- [Dan Dubuque covering QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE's "Little Sister" from LULLABIES TO PARALYZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmBQHzkxdk)
- [Dan Dubuque covering NIRVANA's "Heart Shaped Box" from IN UTERO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C-8W3oiPiA)

I'm really glad people share their music and covers on the web, please tell me all about your favorite cover artists so I can enjoy more covered music!
